# ECS Exploit Go Server

This sample code is for a server that implements the minimum amount of functionality to be able to demo the exploit in [this blog post](https://www.notion.so/hezebnica/Hacking-the-Amazon-Elastic-Container-Service-ECS-Meta-data-Service-be822bad711e468d9adab76566d13259?pvs=4)

The intent is to deploy this as an application running on Amazon ECS and chain the vulnerabilites to extract task iam role credentials from the ECS Instance Metadata Service.
